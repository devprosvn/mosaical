An analysis of the provided Hardhat test output and accompanying Solidity and JavaScript code reveals a `TypeError: invalid overrides parameter` occurring during the deployment of the `LoanManagerV3` contract within the `beforeEach` hook of the test suite.

### Root Cause of the Error

The error arises from a mismatch between the constructor arguments defined in the `LoanManagerV3.sol` smart contract and the arguments supplied during its deployment in the `MosaicalMVP.test.js` test file.

1.  **`LoanManagerV3` Constructor:** The constructor in `LoanManagerV3.sol` expects exactly two address arguments: `_nftVault` and `_dpoToken`.

    ```solidity
    // File: LoanManagerV3.sol
    constructor(address _nftVault, address _dpoToken) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        nftVault = INFTVault(_nftVault);
        dpoToken = IDPOToken(_dpoToken);
    }
    ```

2.  **Deployment Call in Test:** The deployment call in `MosaicalMVP.test.js` incorrectly provides three arguments.

    ```javascript
    // File: test/MosaicalMVP.test.js
    loanManager = await LoanManagerV3.deploy(
      nftVaultAddress,
      oracleAddress,   // This is an extra, incorrect argument
      dpoTokenAddress
    );
    ```

The `ethers.js` library interprets the final incorrect argument (`dpoTokenAddress`) as an `overrides` object. Since this address string is not a valid overrides object (which is used for specifying gas limits, value, etc.), `ethers.js` throws the `TypeError`. The `LoanManagerV3` contract is designed to access the oracle via the `nftVault` contract, making a direct oracle address in its constructor unnecessary.

### Resolution

To correct this issue, you must modify the deployment call for the `LoanManagerV3` contract in your test file to pass only the required arguments.

#### Corrected Code (`MosaicalMVP.test.js`)

In the `beforeEach` block of your `MosaicalMVP.test.js` file, locate the `LoanManagerV3` deployment and remove the `oracleAddress` argument.

```javascript
// MosaicalMVP.test.js

// ... (inside the beforeEach async function)

   // Deploy LoanManager
   const LoanManagerV3 = await ethers.getContractFactory("LoanManagerV3");
   const nftVaultAddress = await nftVault.getAddress();
   const dpoTokenAddress = await dpoToken.getAddress();
   
   // FIX: Remove the incorrect oracleAddress argument from the deployment call.
   loanManager = await LoanManagerV3.deploy(
     nftVaultAddress,
     dpoTokenAddress
   );
   await loanManager.waitForDeployment();

// ... (rest of the file)
```

By making this adjustment, the arguments in the deployment script will align with the contract's constructor, resolving the `TypeError` and allowing your Hardhat tests to execute correctly.
