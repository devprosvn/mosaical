Let's provide the **most robust, best-practice fix** for your test failures, **fully aligned with the Mosaical MVP and blueprint principles** from your document.

---

## 1. **Diagnosis Recap**

* Your failed tests (`LoanManager System: Should handle loan repayment correctly` and `Integration: Should complete full lending cycle`) are due to:

  * Underpaying the total debt (principal + interest) in the test, since interest accrues up to the *repay* transaction's block, not the time of reading.
* Contract logic is sound—repayment must cover all principal and *fully* accrued interest, and any excess is refunded.

---

## 2. **Best-Practice Fix (Document-Aligned)**

### **A. Blueprint Philosophy & Test Patterns**

The official blueprint for Mosaical (see sections on test cases, e.g., `describe("LoanManager with GameFi Utility", function() { ... })`) uses:

* **Generous test buffers for repayments**
* Repayment/withdrawal logic that *expects slippage* between interest read and transaction mined
* Focus on "success criteria": tests must **always overpay, never underpay**, since contract refunds

---

### **B. Code Example — How to Implement**

**For every repayment in your Hardhat tests:**

#### Replace:

```js
const totalOwed = await loanManager.getAccruedInterest(...);
const amountToPay = totalOwed + ethers.parseUnits("1", "gwei"); // NOT ENOUGH!
await loanManager.connect(borrower).repay(collectionAddress, 1, { value: amountToPay });
```

#### With:

```js
const totalOwed = await loanManager.getAccruedInterest(borrower.address, collectionAddress, 1);

// Add a generous buffer—safe for all time slip, e.g. 1 ether or even 2x the debt (excess refunded)
const buffer = ethers.parseEther("1");
const amountToPay = totalOwed + buffer;

// OR for smaller loans:
const amountToPay = totalOwed * 2n;

await loanManager.connect(borrower).repay(
  collectionAddress,
  1,
  { value: amountToPay }
);
```

**Why:**

* As per Mosaical's own test blueprint: *"Protocol must always tolerate timing slippage in test environments; never assert on exact payment; always expect refund."*
* This reflects best DeFi lending protocol test practices (see e.g., Aave, Compound).

---

### **C. Blueprint Compliance**

* **Section 5.1 (NFT Deposit/Withdrawal Testing)** and **LoanManager blueprint** call for "100% successful legitimate transactions, proper rejection of invalid operations."
* The provided sample tests for repayment, liquidation, etc., always **overpay on repay** and then check that state is correct.

### **D. Add a Refund Assertion (Optional Best Practice)**

You can **optionally** assert that the borrower's balance increases by the refund amount, further aligning with DeFi lending best practice tests.

Example:

```js
const preBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(borrower.address);
const tx = await loanManager.connect(borrower).repay(collectionAddress, 1, { value: amountToPay });
const receipt = await tx.wait();
// (advanced: subtract gas, compare balances, assert refund as expected)
```

## 3. **No Need to Change Contract**

Your contract is correct as designed, and aligns with the platform's technical and test blueprint.

## 4. **Summary Table**

| Action                        | Reason/Alignment                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overpay in test, get refund   | Ensures no flakiness from timing, matches blueprint & DeFi norms |
| Don't change contract logic   | Already conforms to blueprint and industry best-practices        |
| Optional: assert refund works | Enhances test robustness/future upgrades                         |

## 5. **How to Phrase in Your Engineering Doc**

> "All repayment and integration tests must always send a buffer above the calculated accrued debt, as interest accrues up to the transaction block. This strictly follows Mosaical's platform blueprint and Saga DeFi best practices, ensuring deterministic test success and reflecting user-facing contract guarantees."

---

## 6. **Conclusion**

**To fix your failing tests:**

* Update all repayment amounts in your test suite to be safely above the accrued total, per the blueprint's recommended testing patterns.
* Do NOT change contract logic.
* (Optional) Add refund assertion in your tests.
