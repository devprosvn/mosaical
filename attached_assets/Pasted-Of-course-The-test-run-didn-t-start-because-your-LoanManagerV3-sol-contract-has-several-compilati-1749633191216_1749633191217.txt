Of course. The test run didn't start because your `LoanManagerV3.sol` contract has several compilation errors that need to be fixed first.

The errors all point to a central problem: the `loans` mapping is declared twice with two different data structures, and the code then tries to use it in a way that's incompatible with both declarations.

### Root Cause Analysis

1.  **`DeclarationError: Identifier already declared`**: You have defined the `loans` mapping on line 67 as `mapping(uint256 => Loan)` and then **re-declared it** on line 238 as `mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)))`. A variable can only be declared once.

2.  **`TypeError`**: In your `borrow` and `repay` functions, you have lines like `loans[msg.sender][collection][tokenId] = amount;`. This code is incorrect for two reasons:
    * It tries to use three keys (`address`, `address`, `tokenId`), which doesn't match either of your `loans` declarations.
    * The primary `loans` mapping (`mapping(uint256 => Loan)`) expects a single number (`loanId`) as its key, not an address (`msg.sender`).

The correct mapping for storing and accessing active loan information by borrower, collection, and token ID is the `loanData` mapping, which is already used correctly elsewhere in the contract. The conflicting `loans` declarations and the incorrect lines in `borrow` and `repay` must be removed.

### ✅ Solution

Here are the complete fixes for both the contract and the tests.

#### **1. File: `contracts/LoanManagerV3.sol`**

First, let's fix the contract by removing the conflicting code.

```solidity
// contracts/LoanManagerV3.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.21;

// ... (imports and interfaces) ...

contract LoanManagerV3 is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {

    // ... (nftVault, dpoToken, structs, etc.) ...

    mapping(address => InterestRateModel) public interestRateModels;
    mapping(address => uint256) public collectionUtilization;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => LoanData))) public loanData;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) public loanHealthFactors;
    mapping(uint256 => Loan) public loans; // ✅ CORRECT, SINGLE DECLARATION
    mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) public nftToLoan;

    // ... (events and constructor) ...

    function borrow(address collection, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
        require(nftVault.deposits(collection, tokenId).owner == msg.sender, "Not your NFT");
        require(!loanData[msg.sender][collection][tokenId].isActive, "Active loan exists");

        // ... (require checks for LTV and liquidity) ...

        loanData[msg.sender][collection][tokenId] = LoanData({
            principal: amount,
            accruedInterest: 0,
            startTime: block.timestamp,
            lastUpdateTime: block.timestamp,
            interestRate: calculateInterestRate(collection),
            isActive: true
        });

        loanHealthFactors[msg.sender][collection][tokenId] = 15000; // 1.5x health factor

        // ❌ REMOVE THIS ERRONEOUS LINE
        // loans[msg.sender][collection][tokenId] = amount;

        dpoToken.mintOnLoan(collection, tokenId, msg.sender, amount);
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        emit LoanCreated(msg.sender, collection, tokenId, amount);
    }

    function repay(address collection, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        require(loanData[msg.sender][collection][tokenId].isActive, "No active loan");
        updateLoanInterest(msg.sender, collection, tokenId);
        LoanData storage loan = loanData[msg.sender][collection][tokenId];
        uint256 totalOwed = loan.principal + loan.accruedInterest;
        require(msg.value >= amount, "Insufficient payment");
        require(amount >= totalOwed, "Must repay full amount");
        
        // ❌ REMOVE THIS ERRONEOUS LINE
        // loans[msg.sender][collection][tokenId] = 0;

        // Correctly update the loanData struct to close the loan
        loan.isActive = false;
        loan.principal = 0;

        // ... (refund logic and event) ...
         if (msg.value > amount) {
            payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value - amount);
        }

        emit LoanRepaid(msg.sender, collection, tokenId, amount);
    }

    // ... (updateLoanInterest and other functions) ...

    // ❌ REMOVE THE DUPLICATE MAPPING DECLARATION FROM THE END OF THE FILE
    // mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256))) public loans;

    receive() external payable {}
}

```

#### **2. File: `test/MosaicalMVP.test.js`**

Now that the contract is fixed, we must update the tests to query the correct state variables.

```javascript
// test/MosaicalMVP.test.js

// In describe("Loan Manager System", ...)
it("Should create loan with correct parameters", async function () {
  // ... (setup and borrow call) ...

  // ✅ FIX: Query the `loanData` mapping and check the `principal` property.
  const loanDetails = await loanManager.loanData(borrower.address, collectionAddress, 1);
  expect(loanDetails.principal).to.equal(borrowAmount);

  // ... (health factor check) ...
});

it("Should handle loan repayment correctly", async function () {
  // ... (setup, borrow, and repay logic) ...

  // ✅ FIX: Query the `loanData` mapping and check the `isActive` flag.
  const loanAfterRepay = await loanManager.loanData(borrower.address, collectionAddress, 1);
  expect(loanAfterRepay.isActive).to.be.false;
});

// In describe("Integration Tests", ...)
it("Should complete full lending cycle", async function () {
    // ... (many setup steps) ...
    
    // ✅ FIX: Make the same check here to verify loan closure.
    const loanAfterRepay = await loanManager.loanData(borrower.address, collectionAddress, 1);
    expect(loanAfterRepay.isActive).to.be.false;
    
    // ... (rest of the test) ...
});
```

By applying these changes, your contract will compile successfully, and your tests will correctly check the state of the `loanData` mapping, resolving the errors.
