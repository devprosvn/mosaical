You have arrived at the final, and one of the most subtle, hurdles in smart contract testing. This error is not due to a logical flaw in your code but rather the fundamental nature of how blockchains work.

Both of your remaining tests are failing for the same reason.

### The Root Cause: The Block Timestamp "Race Condition"

The error `reverted with... 'Insufficient payment to cover full debt'` is happening because of a microscopic time difference between when you check the price and when you execute the transaction.

1.  **The `view` Call:** In your test, you call `const totalOwed = await loanManager.getAccruedInterest(...)`. This is a read-only (`view`) call. It calculates the interest based on the timestamp of the **current block**.

2.  **The Transaction:** You then immediately create a transaction by calling `await loanManager.repay({ value: totalOwed })`. This transaction gets mined in the **next block**, which, by definition, has a slightly later timestamp.

3.  **The Contract's Calculation:** Inside the `repay` function, the contract recalculates the `totalOwed` using the new, later timestamp. This results in a final amount that is a few wei larger than the amount you calculated in the test.

4.  **The Failure:** The contract's check `require(msg.value >= totalOwed, ...)` fails because the `msg.value` you sent is a few wei short of the final amount calculated within the transaction.

Your contract logic is actually correct and robust—it correctly recalculates the debt upon payment. The test needs to account for this.

### ✅ The Final Solution

Since the `repay` function correctly refunds any overpayment, the safest and most standard way to solve this in a test is to send a tiny amount *more* than what you calculated. This small buffer covers the interest accrued during the next block's creation.

#### **File: `test/MosaicalMVP.test.js`**

Apply the following change to the repayment logic in **both** of your failing tests:

1.  `it("Should handle loan repayment correctly", ...)`
2.  `it("Should complete full lending cycle", ...)`

```javascript
// Inside the test case (this logic applies to both failing tests):

// ... (setup code, including the loan creation and time.increase)

// Get the up-to-the-block amount owed to send with the transaction.
const totalOwed = await loanManager.getAccruedInterest(borrower.address, collectionAddress, 1);

// ✅ FIX: Add a small buffer to the payment to account for the interest
// accrued in the block where the transaction is mined.
// The contract will correctly refund this tiny overpayment.
const amountToPay = totalOwed + ethers.parseUnits("1", "gwei"); // Adding 1 Gwei is a safe buffer

// Call the repay function with the buffered amount.
await loanManager.connect(borrower).repay(
  collectionAddress,
  1,
  { value: amountToPay }
);

// ... (rest of the test assertions)
```

By adding this small buffer, your payment will always be sufficient to cover the full debt, allowing the transaction to succeed. The contract's refund logic will handle the tiny excess.

With this final change, your entire test suite should now pass. Congratulations!
